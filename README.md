a gleeful study of neural network and implementing an _vanilla_ nn

The code perceptron.r is mostly inspired by Andrew Ng's _[deep learning courses][dl]_  

Another good MooC I'd like to take is _[Fast AI][fast]_  
(Rachel's profile is more interesting, as she has done tons of sims and nn)    

And this [deep learning course][google_dl] offered by Google and Udacity, I found they have the best visual for concept explanation.


Cheers
